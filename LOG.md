This is where I document each day that I work on the STM32. It includes everything that I tried, all my successes, and all my failures.

General logs will have the following format:

### MM/DD/YYY

__Activity__
- Something that I did

__Issues__
- Any problems encountered

__Possible Solutions and Next Steps__
- What I should do to resolve issues
- Next steps

__Comments__
- Stuff I have to say about what happened
___

# My logs!


### 12/19/2025

__Activity__
- Ordered a Nucleo-144 F439ZI. Mitch Davis' Youtube video on which board to start with helped me choose.
- Installed STMStudio instead of STM32CubeIDE by mistake
- Installed STM32CubeIDE 2.0.0

__Issues__
- None

__Possible Solutions and Next Steps__
- Get familiarized with the IDE
- Read relevant documentation in preparation of creating a blink project

__Comments__
- I'm so excited! Can't wait to make an LED blink :p

### 12/21/2025

__Activity__
- Skimmed the reference manual and datasheet for the STM32F439
- Skimmed the datasheet for the Nucleo-144

__Issues__
- These docs are (expectedly) LARGE

__Possible Solutions and Next Steps__
- I'll need to reference the docs as I go on

__Comments__
- This reference manual is going to carry me
