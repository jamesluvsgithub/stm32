# stm32
Repository for all of the source code for my STM32 projects.

I used a Nucleo-144 F439ZI development board with the STM32F439ZI. All my progress with this project is documented within LOG.md

I used Mitch Davis's Youtube tutorials extensively to get started. I highly recommend it for beginners such as myself.
