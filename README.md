# stm32

The board used is the Nucleo-144 F439ZI. I decided to take a bare-metal approach, manipulating registers directly for things like GPIO, ADC, and DMA.
I only use HAL for system clock configuration.



I used Mitch Davis's Youtube tutorials extensively to get started. I highly recommend it for beginners such as myself.
